sudo apt-get build-dep qgit
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/qgit/qgit4/2.3/qgit-2.3.tar.bz2
tar -xjvf qgit-2.3.tar.bz2
cd qgit
cat /path/to/qgit-2.3_fix_external_diff_binary_writeToFile.patch | patch -p1
qmake qgit.pro

Now you need to toggle to tree view (press t or View->Toggle tree view).
Select a file and double click on it to change the filter of qgit.
Start external diff with ctrl-d or View->External diff

Have fun!
